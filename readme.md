# GitMaster

GitMaster is an AI-powered CLI tool designed to help users interact with GitHub or local repositories. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions about codebases, summarize repositories, review pull requests, and more.

## Features

- Load and index GitHub or local repositories with smart file filtering
- Ask questions about the last loaded repository
- Summarize the contents of a repository
- Review GitHub Pull Requests with AI analysis
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude)
- Manage authentication for GitHub and AI services
- Clear temporary data and vector stores
- Explain and suggest improvements for specific files

## Installation from PyPI

To install GitMaster from PyPI, follow these steps:

1. Install GitMaster using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install gitmaster
   ```

2. Set up your AI service API key:
   ```bash
